# Shopify Sales & Customer Analysis Dashboard – Project Report

## Project Overview & Objective
The Shopify Sales & Customer Analysis Dashboard is an end-to-end Power BI project designed to analyze e-commerce sales performance, customer purchasing behavior, retention metrics, and regional trends.
The objective of this project is to help business stakeholders track revenue growth, understand customer funnel behavior, identify high-performing regions and products, and optimize payment methods using data-driven insights.

This dashboard enables quick decision-making by presenting KPIs, trends, and breakdowns in a single interactive view.

## Problem Statement
E-commerce businesses often struggle with:
- Lack of visibility into overall sales performance
- Limited understanding of customer retention vs new customers
- Difficulty identifying top-performing regions, cities, and products
- No clear insight into preferred payment gateways
- Inability to track sales trends over time for forecasting

The goal was to build a centralized analytical dashboard that answers these questions clearly and visually.
